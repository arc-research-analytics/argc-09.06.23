# ARGC Demo // 09.06.23

Welcome to the GitHub page for Will Wright's ARGC presentation on open source tools for geospatial viz! The demo will walk through how to use Python to create a simple Streamlit web app for visualizing home sales in Forsyth County, GA. Follow the steps below for setting up a virtual environment once you clone this repo. The README file also features helpful documentation links at the bottom.

## Install virtual environment

We will be using several packages for the demonstration. To follow along, you will need the popular package and environment manager conda, which you can easily get by installing the Python distributions Anaconda (great for beginners) or Miniconda (recommended for more experienced programmers). In this demo, we will utilize a conda environment to create a contained "sandbox" that is ready to use for the included Jupyter and Python files.

1) If you don't have Anaconda or Miniconda installed locally, first do so.
2) Clone this repo and navitage to it via terminal or command prompt.
3) Create a new conda environment (which will automatically include all necessary packages) by executing the following bash command:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`. <em>Note: This process may take a few minutes to complete, depending on the speed of your network connection.</em> 

4) Once the environment is created, you need to activate it. Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
`conda activate argc-demo`

5) Set up a jupyter kernel corresponding to the environment you just created (unfortunately, conda no longer automatically sets up environments as jupyter kernels). Never fear, it's not hard. Simply run the following bash command:
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name argc-demo`

6) With the 'argc-demo' environment activated, you can start a Jupyter server in the same terminal or command prompt window using either of the following commands:
`jupyter notebook` - or - `jupyter lab`. Keep in mind JupyterLab is a newer, more feature-rich IDE as compared to the older Jupyter Notebook. You can choose either!  

At this point, you're all set ðŸ”¥
